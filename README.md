## TemplateEngine

# Motivation
This application allows employers to create teams by entering in their employees into a database.  The database will then render the information entered into a webpage in a diagram.

# Installation
In order to use this application, you will need to install npm inquirer using npm i inquirer in your terminal. 

# How to Use
The employer will enter in the name, employee ID number, email and employee role into the system.  Depending on the employee role, a subsequent question will pop up.  For managers, it will ask for an office number.  For engineers, it will ask for the gitHub user name.  For interns, it will ask for the school.  After the data is received, the application will ask the employer if they would like to add another employee.  The employer can continue to do this until all the employees are added.  Once the employer has added all of their employees, they will exit the program.  Upon exiting the program, the data collected will show on a website to create a visual directory of the employees.
